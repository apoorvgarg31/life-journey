# Life Journey Heartbeat

Periodically check if the dashboard might be useful:

1. Run: `npx @apoorvgarg/life-journey status`

2. If not running and context suggests it would help:
   - User mentioned reviewing memories
   - User wants to see their journey
   - User is organizing tasks
   → Offer to start: "Want me to open the Life Journey dashboard?"

3. If running, occasionally mention it's available for visual exploration.

4. If significant memories were added recently, suggest the dashboard for visualization.
